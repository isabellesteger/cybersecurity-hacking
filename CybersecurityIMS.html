      <h2> Black Hat </h2>
		<p> 
			The term ‘Black Hat’ is a hacker culture term that refers to someone that hacks into secure servers, for malicious purposes. These kinds of Black Hat organizations are what is used in movies fairly often, to put fear into people about using safe browsing habits. However, often even safe browsing habits are no match for the skill of groups like this. The term was coined supposedly by a software designer named Richard Stallman, although of course he denies it. Some examples of black hat organizations are: Anoncoders, The Cult of the Dead Cow, Cicada, and Xbox Underground - who hacked a significant amount of Microsoft employees systems.

      <h2> Grey Hat </h2>
		<p> 
			In the middle of the two there is the ‘Grey Hat’. Someone who hacks into a secure server with ethical purposes, but without permission. Now, the legality of this has been questioned by programmers, and the FBI, alike. However, the society of Grey Hats fight back with the term Hacktivism. Overall, what these organizations in the past have done to protect our society of consumers is worth the knowledge that they can get data in the first place. Again another prominant organization would be Anonymous. There was a group called Goatse security that found out there was a problem in AT&T systems where they could see the IP addresses of each IPad user. They reported it to AT&T so they could resolve the problem, and THEN told the media.. And the FBI raided a members house. Yeah.

      <h2> White Hat </h2>
		<p> 
			A ‘White Hat’ is a term used on the internert and throughout programming and hacking culture, to describe someone who hacks into secure servers for <em> ethical purposes.</em>With permission! Often they are persons that specialize in “penetration testing”; they test the durability of secure servers firewalls, for the company itself. One of the first examples of a white hat, was actually in use by the United States Air Force,to test their systems. Probably one of the most iconic and recognizable hacker organizations is Anonymous, they hack into systems to bring forth the truth about corruption and what’s a lie in society, and many movies and documentaries have been made about the society. Although we have to question the legality...
